# My [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) Learning Journey
I do learning-by-doing in this repo, and I make some violations on purpose like the weird project names just to make sure what is the sequence of the contents, so please do not judge me on this :)

## My Main Resources
I'm using multiple resources to study and apply what I learn here with examples. This is a list of **main** resources I use (_I will update this list whenever I use a new resource_):
* [Django: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/django-getting-started/) by [Reindert-Jan Ekker](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/reindertjan-ekker), on [PluralSight.com](https://www.pluralsight.com/).

## Important Resources
* [Django Commands](COMMANDS.md)
* [Useful Links](LINKS.md)
* [Useful {Model}.objects attributes](OBJECTS_METHODS.md)
